<h5>Load testing</h5>

In the past, we have received requests for load testing, however, all the projects that have requested it had a CDN in place.
 Since most load testing services require us to bypass the CDN, there has often been no way need to test it.  Most, if not all 
 CDN's will have a high load capacity and contacting the specific servive provider will often give you the answers you need.
