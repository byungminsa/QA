<h3>Staffing requests</h3>

In order for resources to be allocated, the project manager will allocate the resources via Jira.  If you need to allocate for them, you can access the Jira page here.  
https://monsoonco.atlassian.net/browse/STAFF/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel

<h3>Information needed</h3>
The information needed is percentage and duration.  I.E.  25% for 3 weeks.  The dates to put are in the staffing ticket so there is no need to be concerned with the dates again. 

<h3>Steps</h3>
1. Log into Jira and go to the project called "Monsoon Staffing", key: "STAFF"
2. Click on the create button on top.

<h3>Follow up </h3>  
Once it has been submitted, it's always a good idea to follow up with the resource manager.
