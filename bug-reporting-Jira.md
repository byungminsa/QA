<bold>Pro-tip </bold>  There two ways to access the project, via "Projects" or "Agile" on top.  Project is preferred because when you write a bug, the bug is visible in Project view, while it is not visible in Agile view.  That way you can make adjustments or add to it.

<bold>Pro-tip</bold> Most of the time, the "Project" should never change, however you are going in and out of different projects, the "Project" may change.  

8) Click on "Create" to finish writing the bug.


<h3>Strategy</h3>
If you are planning on writing alot of bugs in a row, you can mark the "Create another" button.  This will save alot of the form information so you won't have to retype alot of things.
