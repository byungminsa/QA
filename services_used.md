<h2>Intro</h2>
This will list services we have tried to use in the past and the experiences

<h3>Testlodge</h3>
This has Jira integration, however it's pretty expensive for a over glorified testplan tracker.  An excel spreadsheet is not as
 fancy but it's easier to use.
 
 <h3>Google Spreadsheets</h3>
 We initially abandoned this but we have brought it back for ease of use and sharing.
