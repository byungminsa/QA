<h4>The age old question, are things better on a device or a simulator for testing</h4>
A simulator is easier to use and quicker.  It could be fired up right away and you never have to worry about having a 
specific device.  As a rule of thumb, simulators can catch up to 80%(rough made up number) of bugs.  There will be often cases
where a bug does not show up in a simulator but does show up on a device.  Visual checks are also not possible on simulators.

The following should be considering for manual testing unless automated testing solutions are discovered.

<ul>
<li>Visual testing</li>
<li>Complex user stories</li>
<li>User story creation</li>
<li>Quick Sanity checks</li>
<li>Project is near the end and no testing will ever be needed afterwards</li>
