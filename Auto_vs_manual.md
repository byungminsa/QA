<h4>Automated testing vs. manual testing </h4>
The following should be considering for manual testing unless automated testing solutions are discovered.

<ul>
<li>Visual testing</li>
<li>Complex user stories</li>
<li>User story creation</li>
<li>Quick Sanity checks</li>
<li>Project is near the end and no testing will ever be needed afterwards</li>
<li>Usability testing - sometimes, the interaction "works" but it's very hard for the user. I.E.  The "x" button is very hard
 to tap on with human hands but it "works"</li>
